#📊 Student Performance EDA (Evidence bsed education insights).

##🔍 A Data driven study for education policy & learning outcomes.

This project analyzes student performance across Math, Reading, and Writing to uncover how learning outcomes are influenced by:(Test preparation, Gender patterns, Nutrition, and Socioeconomic factors).  
The goal is to derive "policy-oriented insights" to support equitable and effective education strategies.

#🏛️ Problem Statement: Despite increasing investment in school education, student academic performance varies widely in math, reading, and writing. Policymakers lack clear data-driven insights on how demographics, test preparation, and resources affect learning outcomes.This study explores performance patterns to support "evidence-based educational reforms" that improve learning quality across schools.

## 🎯 Objectives
* Identify key factors influencing student performance in core subjects.
* Analyze the impact of "test preparation programs" on outcomes.
* Compare performance differences across "gender and resource access".
* Provide actionable policy recommendations for government education bodies.

# Key Insights (Policy-Centric) : * Policy implication
🎓 Students who complete test preparation score significantly higher in all subjects. 1*	Expand low-cost or subsidized test-prep programs nationally.
👩‍🎓 Female students outperform in reading and writing; males slightly lead in math. 2*	Promote gender-inclusive curriculum—focus on writing support for boys, math confidence for girls.
🥗 Students receiving standard lunch perform better than those on free/reduced meals. 3*	Use nutrition programs as an education quality lever; improve midday meal funding.
🧮 Major score variability indicates weak foundational mastery.	 4* Invest in foundational skill programs in grades 6–8.
📉 Outliers with very low scores often correlate with low preparation and socioeconomic constraints. 5*	Prioritize targeted learning support for economically weaker students.
Categorical factors (Gender, Lunch, Test Prep) have noticeable effects on performance.
Most students score around the mean, but some low and high outliers exist.
📌 Policy Recommendations
1.Implement nationwide free test-prep bootcamps in government schools.
2.Launch nutrition-linked learning programs, integrating meals with learning support.
3.Introduce gender-focused interventions, reducing subject-wise disparity.
4.Build “Foundation Labs” in middle schools to strengthen math and reading basics.
5.Deploy data monitoring systems to track student progress annually.

This Student Performance EDA reveals that learning outcomes are influenced not just by academic ability, but by access to resources, nutritional support, and preparatory interventions. The analysis highlights that:
- "Structured test preparation" consistently improves scores across subjects.
- "Socioeconomic indicators", reflected through lunch categories, correlate with performance gaps.
- "Gender-based trends" require targeted curriculum support.
- High score variability indicates the need to "strengthen foundational education", especially in math and literacy.

With data-driven interventions, education systems can improve equality, efficiency, and learning quality. This study shows how EDA can guide "evidence-based policy decisions" for large-scale societal impact.
