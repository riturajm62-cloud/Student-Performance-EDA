# Student Performance Analysis — EDA Project

#Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on student performance data to uncover trends in Math scores, Reading scores, and Writing scores. It also analyzes the impact of categorical variables such as Gender, Lunch Type, and Test Preparation Course, on student performance. The goal is to provide actionable insights and demonstrate data analytics skills.

# Dataset
Source: Kaggle (Student Performance Dataset)
Rows:1000+ students
Columns:8
Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score (numeric)
Gender (male/female)
Lunch (standard / free or reduced)
Test Preparation Course (completed / none)
Note: Dataset is anonymized and publicly available.

#Tools Used
Google Sheets:for data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualizations
Google document:for summarization of results and stats and to write final conclusion

# Analysis & Features
Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, min, max, quartiles, standard deviation
Visualizations: Histograms & boxplots for Math, Reading, Writing scores
Column charts for categorical comparisons: Gender, Lunch, Test Preparation
Key insights derived from data trends
Professional Google Doc report summarizing findings

# Key Insights
1. Female students outperform male students in Reading and Writing; Math scores are similar.
2. Students with Standard lunch have slightly higher average scores than those with Free/Reduced lunch.
3. Completing the Test Preparation Course correlates with higher scores across all subjects.
4. Most students score around the mean, but some low and high outliers exist.
5. Quartile analysis shows middle 50% of students perform consistently.
6. Categorical factors (Gender, Lunch, Test Prep) have noticeable effects on performance.
7. EDA highlights areas where interventions could support lower-performing students.


# How to Use
1. Open the PDF report to view the analysis and charts.
2. Explore the dataset in Google Sheets or Excel to reproduce visualizations.
3. Use insights as examples of data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and EDA techniques for learning or portfolio purposes.
